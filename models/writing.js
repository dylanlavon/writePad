// This model establishes and exports our Writing schema for our Mongo Database. By doing this, we can easily create and manipulate any Writing obect,
// as well as allowing us to easily identify and link the Writing to a specific User and Rating. This file also includes the middleware to delete 
// Writings and their attached Ratings.
// Module created in part by Dylan Britain, Trey Boyer, and Minjing Liang

const mongoose = require("mongoose");

const Rating = require("./rating");

// Establish Writing Schema for MongoDB
// Note that the id field is automatically generated by MongoDB and does not need to be specified in the Schema
// Additionally, rather than specifying a ratingId field, the has-many relationship can be automatically handled by specifying the 'ratings' parameter in the Schema as an array of Ratings Schemas
